# NOCS ‚Äì Numerical Optimal Control Scheme

**NOCS** is a lightweight and efficient C++ framework for solving constrained optimal control problems in robotics. It transcribes continuous-time control problems into nonlinear programs using a custom **Block Indexation Procedure (BIP)**, enabling fast and memory-efficient computation of optimal trajectories.

NOCS supports both **analytical** and **numerical** derivatives of robot dynamics, using libraries like **Pinocchio** and optionally **RBDL**. It is well-suited for robots with many degrees of freedom and has demonstrated competitive performance against frameworks like **CasADi**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting up NOCS test

Clone and build the project with CMake:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daniel-cardona/NOCS.git
cd NOCS
#For nocs compilation without dynamic libraries
./compile_nocs_test.sh
#For nocs compilation with pinocchio library
./compile_pinnochio_tests.sh
```
