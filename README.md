# NOCS ‚Äì Numerical Optimal Control Scheme

**NOCS** is a lightweight and efficient C++ framework for solving constrained optimal control problems in robotics. It transcribes continuous-time control problems into nonlinear programs using a custom **Block Indexation Procedure (BIP)**, enabling fast and memory-efficient computation of optimal trajectories.

NOCS supports both **analytical** and **numerical** derivatives of robot dynamics, using libraries like **Pinocchio** and optionally **RBDL**. It is well-suited for robots with many degrees of freedom and has demonstrated competitive performance against frameworks like **CasADi**.
